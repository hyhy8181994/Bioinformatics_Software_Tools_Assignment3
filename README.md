## Biological question: Does the sister species of Anthophora live in the same geological place?
The bee genus Anthophora is one of the largest in the family Apidae, with over 450 species worldwide in 14 different subgenera. This script will use R language to investigate whether sister species of Anthophora live in the same place.
The project is conducted by following steps:
- Download data from BOLD database
- Filter the data 
- Build phylogeney tree
- match tree with geological information
